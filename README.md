# Initial Commit

In this commit, I started building the landing page step by step.

### What I did:

1. Created the basic project files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and an `assets/images` folder for images.
2. Added the hero image as a background and customized its shape using `mask` and `clip-path`.
3. Structured the hero section with heading, text, buttons, and the floating card.
4. Started working on the rest of the sections, but they are not complete yet.
5. This commit includes only the initial structure with the hero image and its content.

Iâ€™ll continue adding the other sections and push them in separate commits to keep everything organized and clear.
